# Default triple rules
# <uid> <description> <number of triples> <triples> .

# Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.

# UIDs must start with "u_" and may contain "([a-z]|_|[0-9])". They must be enclosed in "<", ">". Those and only those rules matching just the namespaces of known standards must have UIDs that end in "_ns".

# Description is used to add a human readable explanation of the rule's purpose. It must be enclosed in '"'.

# Triple:
# <variable OR anon> <regex OR UID of "property" rule OR URI> <regex OR UID of "object" rule OR "class" rule OR anon node>

# If there are more than one triples, each triple must be in its own line otherwise the entire rule must be in one line.

# Reg. expressions must be enclosed in '"'. Variables must begin with "?" and cannot begin with "?var". Anon nodes begin with "_:".
# End of triple chain is denoted by full stop. During regex matching case is ignored.

# Add custom rules here
