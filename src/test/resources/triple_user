# User added tripe rules
# <uid> <number of triples> <triples> .

# Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.

# UIDs must start with "u_" and may contain "([a-z]|_|[0-9])". They must be enclosed in "<", ">". Those and only those rules matching just the namespaces of known standards must have UIDs that end in "_ns".

# Triple:
# <variable> <UID of "known" or "combined" or "class" rule>
# OR
# <variable> <regex OR UID of "property" rule> <regex OR UID of "object" rule OR special value OR variable OR anon node>

# If there are more than one triples, each triple must be in its own line otherwise the entire rule must be in one line.

# Reg. expressions must be enclosed in '"'. Variables begin with "?". Anon nodes begin with "_:". End of triple chain is denoted by full stop. During regex matching case is ignored.

# Special values
# &lat, &long : check if valid lat, long
# &lat_long : check if valid lat, long pair (comma or space seperated)
# &alt : check if valid altitude
